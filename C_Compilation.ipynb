    "**Describe what the purpose of a Makefile is:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Makefile defines a graph of the dependence of source files. Specifically, it guides how we get the object files from source files and header files through c preprocessor and c compiler, and then get the executable files from object files through c linker.\n",
    " \n",
    "**Describe how the code is organized here. Why is this a reasonable structure?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Initially, we have the source file and header file, and the header file can also be implemented in the source file instead of being a seperate file.  Make will use c processor and c compiler to compily them into the object file.  If it defines the dependence of other object files, c linker will link all of these object files together to create the executable file.   \n",
    "\n",
    "This structure is reasonable, because I can understand the program structure without reading the long source file.  Moreover, the whole process would be painful if I need to go through c preprocessor, c complier, and c linker step by step without makefile.  Make makes life easier.\n",

    "An object file is a compiled file that we get from the source file and header file through c preprocessor and c complier.  The code in an object file is machine code.\n",
